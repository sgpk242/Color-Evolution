# Color-Evolution

main.js creates boxes with random fitnesses using createComponent.js

compete.js is the main algorithm that calls select.js, compete.js, compare.js

Currently, the best 3 members of the population mate with 3 random members of the population to create 3 offspring that replace the 3 worst members of the population. THIS SHOULD BE CHANGED. The best 6 members of the population should mate.
